## What is kidney exchange?

Kidney failure is a life-threatening health issue that affects hundreds of thousands of people worldwide. In the US alone, the waitlist for a kidney transplant has over 100,000 patients. This list is growing: demand far outstrips supply.

A recent innovation, kidney exchange, allows patients to bring an (incompatible) donor to a large pool where they can swap donors with other patients. As of 2012â€“2013, roughly 10% of US kidney transplants occurred through a variety of kidney exchanges. Outside of the US, many countries (the UK, the Netherlands, Portugal, Israel, ...) are fielding exchanges.

## Getting started

OpenKPD requires only two dependencies to run: Java and CPLEX. Any 64-bit installation of [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp) (JRE or JDK) will work with OpenKPD. OpenKPD also requires CPLEX Optimization Studio 12.6.3. CPLEX can be downloaded for free through the [IBM Academic Initiative](https://academic.ibm.com/a2mt/email-auth).
