## Getting started

OpenKPD requires only two dependencies to run: Java and CPLEX. Any 64-bit installation of [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp) (JRE or JDK) will work with OpenKPD. OpenKPD also requires CPLEX Optimization Studio 12.6.3. CPLEX can be downloaded for free through the [IBM Academic Initiative](https://academic.ibm.com/a2mt/email-auth). Below we show how to do this.
