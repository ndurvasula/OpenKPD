Drivers for AAMAS-2014 and workshops
================================

This directory contains the drivers used for experiments for our AAMAS-2014 paper and our AAMAS Workshop on Healthcare and Algorithmic Game Theory submission.  There is a ton of code repetition.

*  `DriverUNOS.java`:
   
   Weighted fairness runs for AAMAS-2014 paper for each of the individual UNOS match runs.

*  `HCAGTDriverUNOS.java`:

   Weighted fairness runs for each of the individual UNOS match runs, doing the max weight vs. failure-aware comparison for HCAGT submission.

*  `HCAGTDriverUNOSGenerator.java`:

   Weighted fairness runs for generated UNOS match runs (using UNOSGenerator), doing the max weight vs. failure-aware comparison for HCAGT submission.
   
* `LexicographicalDriver.java`: 

  Lexicographical fairness runs for AAMAS-2014 paper for simulated data (Saidman, Ashlagi, etc)

* `LexicographicalDriverUNOS.java`:
  
  Lexicographical fairness runs for AAMAS-2014 paper for each of the individual UNOS match runs.
